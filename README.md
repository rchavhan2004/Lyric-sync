Each character is printed with a slight delay, and pauses between lines add to the dramatic effect.

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Lyrics and Delays**:
   - The lyrics are stored as a list of strings.
   - A corresponding list of delays determines how long the program pauses after each line.

2. **Animated Printing**:
   - Characters are printed one at a time using a small delay (`time.sleep`).
   - Each line is followed by a longer delay to match the rhythm.

3. **Customization**:
   - Modify the `lines` list to include your favorite lyrics or phrases.
   - Adjust the `delays` list to sync with the new lyrics.
